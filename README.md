## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

**index.html**
- This will serve as the main HTML page for the application.
- It will contain the user interface elements, such as a button, to interact with the counter.

**layout.html**
- This HTML file will serve as a template for other HTML files.
- It will define the basic structure of the application, including the header, footer, and navigation elements.

### Routes

**main.py**

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/increment', methods=['POST'])
def increment():
    # Fetch the current counter value from the database
    counter_value = get_current_counter_value()

    # Increment the counter value by 1
    counter_value += 1

    # Update the counter value in the database
    update_counter_value(counter_value)

    # Redirect back to the index page to display the updated counter
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)
```

### Functionality Overview

- When the user loads the application, the `index` route is triggered, which renders the `index.html` page.
- When the user clicks the counter button, the `increment` route is triggered.
- This route retrieves the current counter value from the database, increments it by 1, updates the database, and then redirects back to the `index` page.
- The `index` page is updated to display the incremented counter value.
